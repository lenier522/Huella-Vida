    <string name="info_why_title_a">Privileges come with responsibilities.</string>
    <string name="info_why_desc_a">\n Out of the 500 generations of Humanity, since the first agricultural settlements, ours in this beginning of the XXIst century, is the one with highest  average of wellbeing, life expectancy and access to knowledge.\nWhile it also bears the highest levels of injustice, inequality and damage to our planet and all its life species.</string>
    <string name="info_why_title_b">Humanity must stop burning fossil fuels.</string>
    <string name="info_why_desc_b">\n Changing our lifestyle and halting the burning of fossil fuels (result of sediments of thousands of millions of years yet burnt at a rate 10,000 times higher) is vital for the survival of our species and the rest, innocent, of forms of life in planet Earth.</string>
    <string name="info_why_title_c">Our individual contribution is an ethical obligation.</string>
    <string name="info_what_title_a">Know your carbon emissions (footprint) and their effects, act to reduce them and promote the global change we need.</string>
    <string name="info_what_desc_a">\n This app will help you:\n<ul>\n<li>estimate your personal carbon emissions to the atmosphere</li>\n<li>compare them with your country and the world average, as well as with the "<b>ethical threshold</b>"</li>\n<li>know the impact excess emissions will cause  in the coming human generations  and to other firms of life</li>\n<li>explore ways in which you can reduce and mitigate your emissions</li>\n<li>draw a progressive plan to a low or no carbon life</li></ul>\n\nAnd so know which may be your carbon footprint through life, the damage you can prevent doing by reducing your emissions and ways to disseminate your commitment towards a global transformation towards a Humanity clean if carbon emissions and repairing the damage we have inflicted in our planet.</string>
    <string name="info_what_title_b">Ethical threshold </string>
    <string name="info_what_desc_b">\n Since 1850, nearly 2,600 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (GtCO₂), equivalent to 702 billion tons of carbon, have been emitted into the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion and land-use changes (1). In 2022, global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry totaled 37.15 billion metric tons (GtCO₂). These emissions are projected to have risen by 1.1 percent in 2023, reaching a record high of 37.55 GtCO₂ (2).
        \n\n Scientists agree that serious dangers will arise if the global mean temperature increases by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3). The relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and global warming shows that one trillion tons of carbon emissions are linked to a 2-degree Celsius rise. To avoid exceeding this 2-degree increase, we can only emit an additional 300 billion tons of carbon, equivalent to 1,111 billion tons of carbon dioxide.
        \n\n The UN estimates that the worlds population will grow from 8 billion in 2024 to 10.4 billion by 2100 (4). This means humans will accumulate 640 billion life years over the remainder of the century. To keep global warming under 2 degrees during this century (SDG 13.1), the maximum annual average carbon dioxide emissions per person should be 1.73 tons.
        \n\n If current emission trends continue, global emissions could double to 75 billion tons by 2100 (5). This would result in cumulative emissions of 4.26 trillion tons from now until then, which is 3.8 times the remaining carbon dioxide budget. The resulting temperature increase could cause 218 million excess deaths and a loss of approximately 6,500 million life years, averaging about 20 years lost per excess death (5).
        \n\n The excessive carbon emissions beyond ethical limits equate to about two months of life lost for every excess ton of carbon dioxide emitted annually. At current emission levels and trends, this translates to an average of one year lost for EU citizens and three years for those in the US.</string>

    <string name="info_history_content">\n\n<b>The Story of the Hummingbird</b>\n\nOne day a terrible fire broke out in a forest - huge woodlands was suddenly engulfed by a raging wild fire.\n\n Frightened, all the animals fled their homes and ran out of the forest.\n As they came to the edge of a stream they stopped to watch the fire and they were feeling very discouraged and powerless.\n They were all bemoaning the destruction of their homes.\n Every one of them thought there was nothing they could do about the fire, except for one little hummingbird.\n\nThis particular hummingbird decided it would do something.\n It swooped into the stream and picked up a few drops of water and went into the forest and put them on the fire.\n\n Then it went back to the stream and did it again, and it kept going back, again and again and again.\nAll the other animals watched in disbelief; some tried to discourage the hummingbird with comments like, "Don't bother, it is too much, you are too little, your wings will burn, your beak is too tiny, it’s only a drop, you can't put out this fire."\n And as the animals stood around disparaging the little bird’s efforts, the bird noticed how hopeless and forlorn they looked.\n\n Then one of the animals shouted out and challenged the hummingbird in a mocking voice, "What do you think you are doing?" And the hummingbird, without wasting time or losing a beat, looked back and said, "I am doing what I can."</string>

    <string name="info_cal_intro">When entering each of the following data, the app calculates carbon emissions by each type of activity.</string>
    <string name="info_cal_transport">Here we apply the average conversion factors for each type of transport, of carbon emissions by kilometer travelled.\n\n These factors also depend on the type of engine, its age, the kind of fuel, speed, weight and altitude above sea level, factors which, for the moment, and for the sake of simplicity and to result in a user-friendly app, have not been included in the calculation.</string>
    <string name="info_cal_electricity">Here we apply the national average consumption levels in kilowatts-hour, the proportion of renewable sources in the electricity matrix and the national average energy (carbon emissions by watt-hour) in each country, to the household monthly consumption of kilowatts-hour and the persons living in the it, deducting the share of individual renewable sources if present.\n\n In case of not knowing for the moment the consumption in kilowatts-hour  (reflected in the electricity bill) there is an option to estimate a low, average of high consumption vs. The national average.</string>
    <string name="info_cal_heating">Here we apply the national levels of fuel consumption per person, to the energy carbon efficiency (carbon emissions by mass/volume of fuel) of each type of fossil fuels, people living in the household and the proportion of heating supplied by individual renewable sources.\n\n In case of not knowing for the moment the exact monthly heating fuel consumption (reflected in the  gas bill or others) there is an option to estimate the relation - low, average or high - with the national average consumption.</string>
    <string name="info_cal_diet">One important parte if our personal carbon emissions is related to our daily food consumption.\n\n Here we take into account the national estimates of carbon emissions by the agro-industry, the proportion of imported food in the country and the ratios (relations with average carbon emissions by food production and consumption) of the types of diets, from those of high, average or low animal and dairy content (related with higher emissions) to those vegetarian and vegan.\n\n It is then adjusted to the proportion estimated of food from non-local origin (usually packaged).\n\n These factors will depend on the type of food, use of fertilizers and plaguicides, use of GMOs, distance from production site to final consumer and other factors which, for the moment, and for the sake of simplicity and to result in a user-friendly app, have not been included in the calculation.</string>
    <string name="info_cal_others">The individual level of income is related to the expenses in purchasing goods and services, and to the level of savings.\n\n We estimated the carbon emissions related to the overall national average consumption (using gross domestic product -GDP- per capita), the proportion of consumption other than  transport, electricity, heating and food, and the proportion of the national economy depending on global trade, so as to estimate the level of carbon emissions in purchasing those other goods and services.</string>
